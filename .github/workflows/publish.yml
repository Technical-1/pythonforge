# quickforge - PyPI Publishing Workflow
# =============================================================================
# This workflow automatically publishes to PyPI when a GitHub release is created.
# It uses trusted publishing (OIDC) - no API tokens needed!
#
# Setup required:
# 1. Go to PyPI → Your Projects → quickforge → Settings → Publishing
# 2. Add GitHub as a trusted publisher with:
#    - Owner: Technical-1
#    - Repository: quickforge
#    - Workflow: publish.yml
# =============================================================================
